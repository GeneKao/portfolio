# Udacity Full Stack Web Developer
# Project 2 - Build a Portfolio Site

by Gene Ting-Chun Kao

**Result HTML page** can be found [here](https://genekao.github.io/udacity-build-a-portfolio-site/) in my github.io.

This portfolio is using [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework. It is a responsive web design so the layout will be adjusted according to the size of the web browser or screen.

## Highlight
In the HTML file [modal window](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_modal.asp) is used, so more information will show up by clicking the picture or About Me button.
